Annotions:

- requires transient IDs to be activated in your php.ini: session.use_trans_sid=1

- other web technologies used: css

- known bugs/weaknesses:
Due to time issues not much verification is used. (some client side with java script, not much php verification)

- Last minute changes: Email attribute for customer is not marked as optional anymore (contrary to the printout)

- the page where you can modify the customers (customers.php) is not validated because it contains forms in a table which is not possible in XHTML.

- the page which the user is sent to after filling in the password change - form is not in a seperate folder because of some issues with relative paths after including
files that include other includes that are used on other pages too. but all the database changing code is in a seperate php folder which can be protected from unwanted access
